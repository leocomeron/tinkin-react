I created the constants folder containing Recipes.js where the necessary data is located, as there is no API to consume.

I used Material UI to make it easy to incorporate styles. They were adapted to comply with the task of imitating the mockups

I created RecipeItem.js which is then used by props to generate the RecipeList.js

All reusable components like AddButton, Logo, Image, Switcher, SearchBar, Filter were created separately for later use in ReciepeList.js or App.js.
